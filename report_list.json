A discrete Gronwall-type inequality  is developed for the nonuniform L1 formula by introducing a discrete convolution kernel of Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. To simplify the consistence analysis of nonuniform L1 formula, we bound the local truncation error by a discrete convolution form with the L1 coefficients, and consider a global convolution error with the discrete Riemann-Liouville integral kernel. With the help of discrete fractional Gronwall-type inequality and global consistence error analysis, a new $L^2$-norm error estimate reflecting the regularity of solution is obtained for a simple discrete scheme on nonuniform time meshes.

Based on preconditioning results for Navier-Stokes equations and Maxwell equataions,\nan efficient preconditioner is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the Krylov subspace methods such as GMRES when solving the linearized problem of the discrete magnetohydrodynamic equations.

In this paper, we propose a new TV-Stokes\nmodel for image deblurring with a good geometry explanation. In the tangential field smoothing, the data fidelity term is chosen to measure the distance between the solution and the orthogonal projection of the tangential field of the observation image onto the range of the conjugate of the blurry operator, while the total variation of the solution is chosen as the regularization term. In the image reconstruction, we compute the smoothing part of the image from the smoothed tangential field for the first step, and use an anisotropic TV model to obtain the “texture” part of the deblurred image. The solvability properties for the minimization problems in two steps are established, and fast algorithms are presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new deblurring model can capture the details of images hidden in the blurry and noisy image, and the fast algorithms are efficient and robust.",

The methods investigated in this paper extend the precedent realizations, limited to the finite element framework, to finite difference discretizations. They also overcome the resolution of a Saddle point problem for which only sparse direct solvers have been successfully operated so far. Although very efficient for two dimensional computations, the cost of direct methods is considerable for real scale three dimensional problems hardly addressed in precedent achievements. This difficulty receives an appropriate answer in this paper, the new methods providing system matrices with a condition number uniformly bounded with respect to the anisotropy strength without the resolution of a Saddle point problem. An iterative resolution of the AP scheme is developed, offering a numerical cost comparable to the resolution of isotropic elliptic problems. This brings a leap forward in the computational efficiency of the method, conclusively outlined thanks to three dimensional serial computations carrying out tens of millions of unknowns.",

        "abstract": "In this talk, we focus on the energy stable schemes for some phase field models. First, we present two nonlinear schemes for a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation with variable interfacial coefficient, modeling the microstructure of the macromolecular microsphere composite hydrogel, by using the convex splitting technique. Then, we consider the exponential time differencing (ETD) method for the epitaxial growth model without slope selection and establish the energy stability and error estimates of the proposed explicit ETD schemes. Next, in our newest work, we consider a class of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations corresponding to an energy functional coming from the classical Ginzburg-Landau free energy with the Laplacian replaced by a well-defined nonlocal diffusion operator. The lack of the high order diffusion term becomes the main difficulty for the numerical analysis and the nonlocal term usually leads to expensive calculations. We propose the stabilized linear semi-implicit schemes with first and second order temporal accuracy by adding an artificial term and analyze the energy stability and error estimates. Numerical experiments are presented to make a comparison of the phase transition process with the corresponding local case.",

It's worth mentioning that both $B_h^a$ and $B_h^{sm}$ involve a SFVE sub-system with respect to a simple coarse space and SFVE sub-systems which are self-similar to the original SFVE system but embarrassingly parallel. Next, the nearly optimal estimation $\\mathcal{O}((1+\\log\\frac{d}{h})^3)$ on condition numbers is proved for the resulting preconditioned systems, where $d$ and $h$ respectively denote the maximum diameters in coarse and fine grids. Moreover, we present algebraic and parallel implementations of $B_h^a$ and $B_h^{sm}$, develop parallel PCG solvers, and provide the numerical results validating the aforementioned theoretical estimations and stating the good algorithmic and parallel scalability.",

In compare with the standard a priori error estimates, which only yield information on the asymptotic error behaviour in a global sense, our proposed error estimate considers the effect of local element geometry properties, and is thus more accurate.

A Peaceman-Rachford type iteration is used as a smoother to decouple the nonlinearity from the divergence constraint. The nonlinear equation can be solved element-wise with a closed formulae. The linear saddle point system for the constraint is reduced into a symmetric positive definite system of Poisson type. Furthermore an empirical choice of the parameter used in the splitting is proposed and the resulting multigrid method is robust to the so-called Forchheimer number which controls the strength of the nonlinearity. By comparing the number of iterations and CPU time of different solvers in several numerical experiments, our multigrid method is shown to convergent with a rate independent of the mesh size and the Forchheimer number and with a nearly linear computational cost.",

The main\nresults of this paper can be listed as the following two parts: 1) By using the norm inequality\nbetween Lq and L2 and the square root lifting inequality, we present several new theoretical\nestimates regarding the recoverability for both sparse and non-sparse signals via Lq minimization.\nAt the same time, based on the work of Candes, we establish new results of TL1 minimization\nabout the accuracy of the reconstruction from underdetermined measurements which improve on\nthe earlier estimates derived by Zhang and Xin, and have the advantage of being more elegant.\n2) We then combine this method with the stochastic collocation to identify the coefficients of\nsparse orthogonal polynomial expansions, stemming from the field of uncertainty quantification.\nWe obtain recoverability results for both sparse polynomial functions and general non-sparse\nfunctions. We also present various numerical experiments to show the performance of the Lq\nand TL1 algorithm. In each part, we first present some bench mark tests to demonstrate the\nability of Lq and TL1 minimization to recover exactly sparse signals, and then consider using\nthe orthonormal polynomials expansions to approximate some classical analytical functions, and\npresent the advantage of this method over other optimization methods (for example, standard\nL1, reweighted L1 minimization, L1−L2 minimization).

The basis of meshless methods is shape functions. The moving least squares (MLS) approximation is an important method to form shape functions in mshless methods. \n    For the application of MLS-based meshless methods to the numerical solution of boundary value problems, it is fundamental to analyze the MLS approximation. This report begins by discussing error estimates of the MLS approximation.\n    The element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is a typical domain-type meshless method based on coupling the MLS approximation and the global Galerkin weak form. Error analysis of the EFG method is then provided theoretically. \n    To retain the merits of both the boundary element method in dimension reduction and the meshless method in elements elimination, a Galerkin boundary node method (GBNM), is developed by combining the MLS approximation and a variational form of boundary integral equations. Boundary conditions in the GBNM can be applied directly and easily despite the MLS shape functions lack the delta function property. Besides, the GBNM keeps the symmetry and positive definiteness of the variational problems. Error analysis of the GBNM is established. \n",

Using Cahn--Hilliard equation, the internal structure of the interface layer is determined by explicit smoothing of the flow discontinuities. This method greatly simplifies gridding, discretization and handing of topological changes. However, the original Cahn—Hilliard equation  has intrinsic dynamics such as interface length minimization, i.e., the motion by minus the Laplacian of the mean curvature. When we apply the Cahn--Hilliard equation to model multiphase fluid flows, we want to minimize its interface length minimization property. Furthermore the surface tension formulation requires the interface of multiphase fluids be a hyperbolic tangent profile. Typically, under the advection of flow, the interfacial transition is not the hyperbolic tangent profile. That is, the interfacial transition is too compressed or sharpened. Even though the original Cahn--Hilliard dynamics conserves the total mass, the conservation of the enclosed area obtained by its interface can not remain. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a modified Cahn—Hilliard equation with an interfacial profile correction term. Several numerical examples are presented to show the accuracy of the proposed method. The numerical results show that the proposed modified Cahn--Hilliard equation has better enclosed area preservation.\n",

The smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD), a particle-based method, is one of the easy and flexible methods to model such complex structure fluids. It couples the best features of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), with parameters having specific physical meaning (coming from SPH discretizatoin of the Navier-Stokes equations), combined with thermal fluctuations in a mesoscale simulation,in a similar manner to the DPD. On the other hand, the immersed boundary method (IBM), a preferred method for handling fluid-structure interaction problems, has also been widely used to handle the fluid-RBC interaction in RBC simulations. In this paper we aim to couple SDPD and IBM together to carry out the simulations of RBCs in complex flow problems. First, we develop the SDPD-IBM model in details, including the SDPD model for the evolving fluid flow, the RBC model for calculating RBC deformation force, the IBM for treating fluid-RBC interaction, and the solid boundary treatment model as well. We then conduct the verification and validation of the combined SDPD-IBM method.

The feature of this method is that by adjusting the penalty parameter, some of the resulted discrete eigenvalues are upper bounds of exact ones, and the others are lower bounds, and consequently a large portion of them can be reliable and approximate eigenvalues with high accuracy. Furthermore, we design an algorithm to select a penalty parameter which meets the condition. Finally we provide numerical tests to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

Numer. Anal., 33(6) 1996: 2401-2416], Benamou proved the convergence of a nonoverlapping Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) method with various Robin type transmission conditions. However, to achieve the possibly best performance of the DD method, the free parameters involved in these transmission conditions should be further optimized, which is the central idea of the well known Optimized Schwarz Methods (OSMs) that have been shown their efficiency in many applications. In this talk, we analyze in detail the OSMs for the optimal control of systems governed by elliptic partial differential equations without constraint. We drive first the transparent boundary conditions on the interface, which highlights us in the design of various local transmission conditions, including those mentioned by Benamou, the variants of the second order and the two-sided types applied in OSMs for second order elliptic PDEs. We then through optimizing the corresponding convergence factors to determine the asymptotically best transmission parameters for each kind of transmission conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic convergence rate estimates. We find that the weight parameter enters both the predicted transmission parameters and the asymptotic convergence rate estimates. We find as well that the weight parameter plays an important role on the performance of the OSMs: the smaller the weight parameter is, the faster the OSMs converge. While when the weight parameter goes to infinity, we arrive at the results for solving a biharmonic problem using mixed form. We use numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "     This paper constructs  an efficient hybrid Monte Carlo variance reduction method for pricing European options driven by Levy process. The hybrid variance reduction method combines conditional Monte Carlo(CMC) and importance sampling(IS) technique. Owing to the structure of movement of asset price and Black-Scholes formula,   we formulate the conditional expectation of the European option price under Levy process and then the IS method is used to reduce simulation variance greatly. Since the conditional expectation formula is smooth with respect to(w.r.t) the concerned parameters, the Greeks, which means the gradient of the option price to the parameters, can be calculated conveniently and efficiently. Furthermore, we proposed a very efficient prediction-correction algorithm to determine the optimal parameters in the importance sampling measure based on the moments match idea and iteration correction algorithm. Numerical examples confirm that our hybrid acceleration method has reasonable variance reduction effect and the prediction-correction algorithm determining the optimal parameters in the importance sampling measure can save a lot of time cost than the traditional Newton's iteration method. Some theoretical results are also given such as convergence of sample average approximation (SAA) method and the existence and uniqueness of the optimal problem determining the parameters in the importance sampling measure.",

Even though the matrices of the algebraic equation corresponding the nonlocal models are usually Toeplitz (denote $a_0$ as the principal diagonal element, $a_1$ as the trailing diagonal element, etc).  There are still some differences for the models in these two fields. For the model of anomalous diffusion, $a_0/a_1$ is uniformly bounded; most of the time,  $a_0/a_1$ of the model for peridynamics is unbounded as the stepsize h tends to zero. Based on the uniform boundedness of $a_0/a_1$, the convergence of the two-grid method is well established [Chan, Chang, and Sun,  SIAM J. Sci. Comput.,  19 (1998), pp. 516--529; Pang and  Sun,  J.

Based on the gradient theory of thermodynamics and variational calculus, a generalized chemical equilibrium equation is obtained with extremely strong nonlinear source term. Through adding a time-derivative term, the steady-state equation is converted to a time-dependent parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). In addition, a Lagrange multiplier is introduced to enforce mass conservation. And then, a mass conserving LB scheme is proposed to solve this transient system. The Lagrange multiplier is defined based on the mesoscopic character of the proposed LB scheme. Furthermore, using the multi-scale Chapman-Enskog analysis, the time-dependent parabolic PDE can be recovered with second order accuracy from the proposed LB scheme. Finally, the three-dimensional numerical simulations of realistic hydrocarbon components, such as isobutane\nand propane, are implemented to illustrate the theory.

        "abstract": "A new variational formulation of the triple junction equilibrium has been proposed for the dynamic wetting flow simulations in fibrous media. The main idea of the approach is to consider the Laplace's law not only over the liquid - gas interface, but also over the liquid - solid and gas - solid interfaces. Hence, when the substrate is planar, the triple line motion is not driven by the solid curvature, but by the jump of the surface tension parameter. The Laplace's law is expressed in a weak form to take into account this discontinuity, which appears as a Neumann boundary condition in the model. Both liquid and gas are assumed to be incompressible Newtonian fluids with different viscosities. The resulting Stokes's equations are solved by using finite elements, linear both in velocity and pressure, stabilised by a variational multiscale method. The moving interface is captured by a Level-Set methodology, combined with a mesh adaptation technique. In the elements crossed by the interface, the discrete pressure field is enriched in order to describe the pressure discontinuity. This framework is assessed with 2D-simulations of a droplet spreading. 3D-simulations of classic wetting problems are also investigated. Expected numerical results are obtained.",

The order of superconvergence is $2k+1$, when the polynomials of degree at most $k$ are used. Even though the linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation involves only second order spatial derivative, it is actually a wave equation because of the coefficient i. It is not coercive and there is no control on the derivative for later time based on the initial condition of the solution itself, as for the parabolic case. In our analysis, the special correction functions and special initial conditions are required, which are the main differences from the linear parabolic equations. We also rigorously prove a $(2k+1)$-th order superconvergence rate for the domain, cell averages, and the numerical fluxes at the nodes in the maximal and average norm.

However, the highly approximation to non-smooth functions is a huge challenge in Science and Engineering. we devote to constructing the fractional Hermite interpolation formulas, which are based on local fractional Taylor expansions, for non-smooth functions. Firstly, the unique existence of the Hermite interpolation formulas is proved, and the corresponding explicit expressions and error remainders are derived. In addition, the convergent order of the piecewise hybrid interpolation, a combination of fractional-order Hermite interpolation and integer-order Hermite interpolation, is discussed.

We address the issue of why the second order maximum entropy model, by using only firing rates and second order correlations of neurons as constraints, can well capture the observed distribution of neuronal firing patterns in many neuronal networks, thus, conferring its great advantage in that the degree of complexity in the analysis of neuronal activity data reduces drastically from O( ) to O( ), where n is the number of neurons under consideration. We first derive an expression for the effective interactions of the n-th order maximum entropy model using all orders of correlations of neurons as constraints and show that there exists a recursive relation among the effective interactions in the model. Then, via a perturbative analysis, we explore a possible dynamical state in which this recursive relation gives rise to the strengths of higher order interactions always smaller than the lower orders. Both numerical simulations and experimental data demonstrate the existence of such dynamical state in neuronal network dynamics. Finally, we invoke this hierarchy of effective interactions to provide a possible mechanism underlying the success of the second order maximum entropy model.",

With the help of the dual system and a simple representation of the relationship between the field variable error and the residual of the primal system, a sharp output error bound is derived. Such an error bound successfully avoids the accumulation of the residual over time, which is a common drawback in the existing error estimations for time-stepping schemes. An estimation needs to be performed for practical computation of the error bound, and as a result, the output error bound reduces to an output error estimation. The proposed error estimation is applied to several kinds of problems and the numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the proposed error estimation. ",

In implicit Poisson-Boltzmann modeling, membrane protein system has two additional features relative the usually treated solvated biomolecule: a membrane region occurs besides of the solvent and solute regions, and periodic boundary conditions on x- and y- directions (in membrane plane) may be necessary. We present finite element solutions to the PBE for membrane protein system. The corresponding meshing tools \nare also provided to generate triangular surface and tetrahedral volume mesh for such a multiple-region domain. In particular, each atomic point charge in protein is exactly located at a node of the mesh, and the channel region, if exited such as in a channel protein, can be correctly recognized and marked in the generated mesh. Different dielectric coefficients are \nassigned to solvent, solute and membrane regions, respectively. Both periodic and nonperiodic solutions are presented and compared. To calculate the full solvation energy of a membrane protein, in addition to the PB electrostatic solvation energy, a method is implemented to counter for the nonpolar solvation contribution which is approximated by a function depending linearly on the solvent-accessible surface area modified by the parameters assumed to vary only along the z direction.

In this talk, the computation of the equilibrium melting path is made possible by coupling the string method with the molecular dynamics. We investigate the microscopic mechanism of the formation of the liquid nucleus in the bulk hexagonal ice, and disclose a different scenario from the classical nucleation theory at the early stage of the melting.

The proposed finite difference schemes  not only conserve the mass and energy in the discrete level but also are efficient in  practical computation because only two linear systems need to be solved at each time step. Besides the standard energy method, an induction argument as well as a `lifting' technique are introduced to establish rigorously the optimal H2-error estimates without any restrictions on the grid ratios, while the previous works either are not rigorous enough or often require certain restriction on the grid ratios. The convergence rates of the proposed schemes are proved to be at O(h^2+\\tau^2)$ with mesh-size  h  and time step  \\tau  in the discrete  H2-norm. The analysis method can be directly extended to other linear  finite difference schemes for solving the KGS equations in high dimensions.

For longer rods we find that the formation of the (stable) smectic phase out of a supersaturated isotropic state is strongly suppressed by an isotropic-nematic spinodal instability that causes huge spinodal-like orientation fluctuations with nematic clusters diverging in size.

The study introduces a simple but very efficient asymptotic preserving reformulation for the magnetic field that has closed field lines. The new reformulated system removes the ill-posedness in\nthe strongly anisotropic limit. Numerical discretiztions for the reformulated system based on non-aligned Cartesian grids are presented. On the one hand, the scheme exhibits uniform second convergence with respect to the anisotropy strength, while on the other hand, the condition numbers do not scale with the the anisotropy strength.

        "abstract": "In this talk, we develop  spatial-temporally second-order, energy stable numerical schemes for two classes of hydrodynamic phase field models of binary viscous fluid mixtures of different densities. One is quasi-incompressible in which the velocity field is the mass average velocity, while the other is incompressible in which the velocity field is volume average one. We introduce a novel linearization technique to arrive at fully discrete linear schemes, where in each time marching step only a linear algebraic equation system needs to be solved. In particular, the linearization technique does not rely on the specific form of the bulk free energy so long as it is bounded below.  These schemes are then proved to be unconditionally energy stable rigorously subject to periodic boundary conditions so that a large time step is plausible. Both spatial and temporal mesh refinements are presented to illustrate the second order accuracy of the schemes.   Several numerical examples, including coarsening dynamics of two immiscible fluids and a heavy fluid  drop settling in a lighter fluid matrix, are presented to show the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed linear schemes. Predictions by the two fluid mixture models are compared and discussed. As the density difference between the two fluid components are large, the two hydrodynamic phase field models indeed predict quite distinct transient dynamics. We believe the quasi-incompressible model is more reliable than the incompressible one.",

Since the expression of normal flux depends on auxiliary unknowns defined at cell-vertex including hanging nodes, we propose a new method to eliminate vertex-unknown by using primary unknowns at the centers of the cells sharing the vertex. Especially the unknowns defined on hanging nodes are eliminated by flux continuous conditions. The resulting scheme is monotone and preserves positivity of analytical solutions for strongly anisotropic and heterogeneous full tensor coefficient problems. Numerical results show that the convergent order of the monotone scheme by different methods of eliminating vertex unknowns will vary remarkably, and our new method can assure that it has almost second order accuracy and more accurate than some existing methods.",

One can expect a difference scheme to have this property only if the boundary value problem that it approximates satisfies a continuous maximum principle. Thus it is of interest to investigate when fractional-derivative boundary value problems satisfy maximum principles---this is a non-trivial question in general. For the Caputo two-point boundary value problem that we will consider, an example shows that, unlike the classical elliptic case, Dirichlet boundary conditions won't guarantee a maximum principle. What boundary conditions will yield a maximum principle? To the best of our knowledge, only one maximum principle result is known for this Caputo problem, and it is easy to see that this result is not sharp. We derive an explicit formula for the Green's function of our boundary value problem. After some analysis of this Green's function we obtain a sharp maximum principle.",

        "abstract": "The radiation hydrodynamic problem is a classic multi-physical and multi-scale problem, which occurs in many applications such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF), strong explosion and astrophysical systems. When we numerically simulate this problem, we usually need to solve the radiation diffusion equations with discontinues or multi-scale coefficients. Owing to the numerical stability, we use the fully implicit computation scheme to discretize these equations, which lead to a large nonlinear algebraic system at each time step. The computational cost of solving this system is very expensive, and so we have to use massive parallel computer in order to get the numerical solution within an acceptable time. However the implicit scheme cannot be implemented directly on parallel computer since there is strong data coupling among the computation meshes, it is very difficult to design the parallel computation method. In this talk, we discuss an efficient parallelization algorithm for the radiation diffusion equation. This algorithm is based on the domain decomposition method, and it integrates the extrapolation technique and the Jacobi style semi-implicit scheme, which present a novel prediction approach for the inner bound values of the sub-domains. This algorithm makes the prediction value of the inner bound more reasonable and gives relatively accurate iterative initial value, which can decrease the number of iterations and improve the parallel computation efficiency remarkably.",

Our recent studies have extended its applications to solve FBSDEs with jumps and stochastic optimal control problems.

The most important advantage of the multistep scheme is that highly accurate numerically solutions can be obtained for the BSDE, which are usually our quantities of interest, while the forward SDE is solved by the simplest Euler scheme with only one jump therein. This feature leads to a dimension reduction when calculating the stochastic integral with respect to Poisson random measure, which greatly reduces the computational complexity and shows a very promising prospect for solving high-dimensional FBSDEs.",

In the previous literature, some theoretical models were used to predict the experimental phenomena of the phenotypic equilibrium, which were often explained by different concepts of stabilities of the models. Here we present a stochastic multi-phenotype branching model by integrating conventional cellular hierarchy with phenotypic plasticity mechanisms of cancer cells. Based on our model, it is shown that: (i) our model can serve as a framework to unify the previous models for the phenotypic equilibrium, and then harmonizes the different kinds of average-level stabilities proposed in these models; and (ii) path-wise convergence of our model provides a deeper understanding to the phenotypic equilibrium from stochastic point of view. That is, the emergence of the phenotypic equilibrium is rooted in the stochastic nature of (almost) every sample path, the average-level stability just follows from it by averaging stochastic samples.

They are closely related to the best complex rank-one approximations to higher-order tensors. The problem of finding US-eigenpairs can be regarded as an unconstraint nonlinear optimization problem with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables. Optimization methods of this kind of problem often need a first- or second-order derivative of the objective function. However, such methods cannot be applied to real valued functions of complex variables because they are not necessarily analytic in their argument. In this paper, we first prove that the number of US-eigenvalues of a symmetric complex tensor is finite. Then, we study how to find US-eigenvalues of a symmetric complex tensor. We establish the first order complex Taylor series and Wintinger calculus of complex gradient of real-valued functions with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables.

        "title": "A Weak Galerkin Method with an Over-Relaxed Stabilization for Low Regularity Elliptic Problems",
        "abstract": "A new weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method is developed and analyzed for solving second order elliptic problems with low regularity solutions in the Sobolev space $W^{2,p}(\\Omega)$ with $p \\in (1, 2)$. A WG stabilizer was introduced by Wang and Ye (Math Comput 83:2101–2126, 2014) for a simpler variational formulation, and it has been commonly used since then in the WG literature. In this work, for the purpose of dealing with low regularity solutions, we propose to generalize the stabilizer of Wang and Ye by introducing a positive relaxation index to the mesh size h. The relaxed stabilization gives rise to a considerable flexibility in treating weak continuity along the interior element edges. When the norm index $p \\in (1, 2)$, we strictly derive that the WG error in energy norm has an optimal convergence order $O(h^{l+1− 1/ p− p /4 })$ by taking the relaxed factor $\\beta = 1+ 2 /p − p /2 $, and it also has an optimal convergence order $O(h^{l+2− 2/ p} )$ in $L^2$ norm when the solution $u\\in W^{l+1,p} $ with $p \\in [1, 1 + 2/ p − p /2 ]$ and $l\\geq 1$. It is recovered for $p = 2$ that with the choice of $\\beta = 1$, error estimates in the energy and L2 norms are optimal for the source term in the sobolev space $L^2$. Weak variational forms of the WG method give rise to desirable flexibility in enforcing boundary conditions and can be easily implemented without requiring a sufficiently large penalty factor as in the usual discontinuous Galerkin methods. In addition, numerical results illustrate that the proposed WG method with an over-relaxed factor $\\beta(\\geq 1)$ converges at optimal algebraic rates for several low regularity elliptic problems.\n\n",

For the well-prepared initial data, the CNFD is uniformly convergent for $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1]$, with second order accuracy in space and $O(\\tau^{4/3})$ accuracy in time.

Then we present the fully discrete energy stable schemes by using finite differences in time and $C^0$-finite elements in space where the fourth order equation shall be transformed into two second order equations. At last we calculate several numerical tests to illustrate the temporal accuracy of the proposed schemes and verify that our schemes are unconditionally energy stable.

In addition, a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method combining the first order convex splitting scheme is employed to improve the temporal accuracy. The SDC method is high order accurate and stable numerically with the time step proportional to the spatial mesh size. The resulting algebraic equations at the implicit level are nonlinear. Due to the local properties of the LDG methods, the resulting implicit scheme is easy to implement and can be solved in an explicit way when it is coupled with iterative methods. An efficient nonlinear multigrid method are used to solve the equations. Numerical experiments of the accuracy and long time simulations are presented to illustrate the high order accuracy in both time and space, the capability and efficiency of the proposed methods.",

For radially symmetric kernels, the nonlocal operators under consideration are diagonalizable in Fourier space. A challenge is the accurate and fast evaluation of the Fourier symbols which consist of  possibly singular and highly oscillatory integrals. For a large class of fractional power-like kernels, we propose a new approach to reformulate the Fourier symbols as coefficients of a series expansion which correspond to solutions of some simple ODE models. We then propose a hybrid algorithm to provide fast evaluation of Fourier symbols in both one and higher dimensional spaces. As applications, we combine this hybrid spectral discretization in the spatial variables and fourth-order exponential time differencing Runge--Kutta for temporal discretization to approximate some nonlocal gradient flows including nonlocal Allen--Cahn equation, nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation, and nonlocal phase-field crystal models.

A whole branch of experimental physics exists, known as quantum tomography, the purpose of which is reconstructing the Wigner function from measurements.

Despite the theoretical advantages, numerical resolutions for the Wigner equation is notoriously difficult and remains one of the most challenging problems in computational physics. The commonly used finite difference methods fail to capture the highly oscillatory structure accurately. We completed the design and implementation of a highly accurate numerical scheme for the Wigner quantum dynamics in 4D phase space. Our algorithm combines an efficient conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme in the temporal-spatial space with an accurate spectral element method in the momentum space.

        "abstract": "Institute of Computational Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Abstract: Many model problems in applied sciences are in the formulation of fourth order problems. Their discretizations have been drawing wide interests. In this talk, some recent progress on designing and implementing order reduced methods for fourth order problems by the speaker and his collaborators will be presented. First of all, a routine framework will be given which transforms the primal fourth order problem to a stable system on a series of low order spaces. The well-posedness of the generated system and the equivalence between the primal formulation and the order reduced formulation can be guaranteed provided mild hypotheses. This way, the framework works for a wide class of fourth order problems. The new formulation admits discretisation with low-regularity finite element spaces, and convenience may thus be expected. Then, some examples are given to illustrate the implementation of the framework. A series of examples on the low-regularity discretisation of boundary value problems about several typical fourth order operators are discussed, finite element schemes are constructed for each of them, and optimal convergence rates are obtained. A second series of examples are on fourth order eigenvalue problems. With the low-regularity finite element spaces utilised, nested discretizations can be admitted. We will focus on, beyond the schemes themselves, the designing and implementation of associated multilevel method and their optimal efficiency. Examples include linear and nonlinear, and self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint problems. Some related topics can also be mentioned.",

First, we construct a local parametrix for the interior transmission problem near the boundary in the Laplace domain, by using the theory of pseudo-differential operators with a large parameter. Second, by carefully analyzing the analyticity of the Green function in the Laplace domain and estimating it there, a local parametrix for the original parabolic interior transmission problem is obtained via the inverse Laplace transform. Finally, using a partition of unity, we patch all the local parametrices and the fundamental solution of the diffusion operators to have a parametrix for the parabolic interior transmission problem, and then compensate it to get the Green function.

The performance of both DDG method and DDG(IC) method is carefully investigated and evaluated through typical test cases.

Some properties of the moment system are also proved. They include the eigenvalues and their bound as well as eigenvectors, hyperbolicity, characteristic fields, linear stability, and Lorentz covariance. A semi-implicit numerical scheme is presented to solve a Cauchy problem of our hyperbolic moment system in order to verify the convergence behavior of the moment method. The results show that the solutions of our hyperbolic moment system converge to the solution of the special relativistic Boltzmann equation as the order of the hyperbolic moment system increases.

        "abstract": "A free energy-based surface tension force (FESF) model is presented for accurately resolving the surface tension force in numerical simulation of multiphase flows by the level set method. By using the analytical form of order parameter along the normal direction to the interface in the phase-field method and the free energy principle, FESF model offers an explicit and analytical formulation for the surface tension force. The only variable in this formulation is the normal distance to the interface, which can be substituted by the distance function solved by the level set method. On one hand, as compared to conventional continuum surface force (CSF) model in the level set method, FESF model introduces no regularized delta function, due to which it suffers less from numerical diffusions and performs better in mass conservation. On the other hand, as compared to the phase field surface tension force (PFSF) model, the evaluation of surface tension force in FESF model is based on an analytical approach rather than numerical approximations of spatial derivatives. Therefore, better numerical stability and higher accuracy can be expected. Various numerical examples are tested to validate the robustness of the proposed FESF model. It turns out that FESF model performs better than CSF model and PFSF model in terms of accuracy, stability, convergence speed and mass conservation. It is also shown in numerical tests that FESF model can effectively simulate problems with high density/viscosity ratio, high Reynolds number and severe topological interfacial changes.",

In some cases, it is possible to write down an exact boundary condition at an artificial boundary (for truncating the unbounded domain) using proper nonlocal operators. These boundary conditions work extremely well for 2D problems, where the artificial boundary is one-dimensional. However, the boundary conditions involving nonlocal operators become too expensive for 3D problems. In the case of periodic waveguides, the number of propagating modes is usually finite. Therefore, away from local distortions, the wave field can be approximated by a sum of incoming and outgoing propagating modes.

In contrast to other existing methods, our emphasis is placed on the ease of implementation. In particular, we propose a method for which the implementation can be done within existing molecular dynamics code, and it is insensitive to lattice structure, the geometry and space dimension of the computational domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the results from two test problems are presented.",

In 1982, Fortin and Glowinski suggested to enlarge the range of the step size for updating the dual variable in ADMM from $1$ to $(0,\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})$; and this strategy immediately accelerates the convergence of ADMM for most of its applications. Meanwhile, Glowinski raised the question of whether or not the range can be further enlarged to $(0,2)$; this question remains open with nearly no progress in the past decades. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively for the case where both the functions in the objective are quadratic. Glowinski's open question is thus partially answered. We further establish the global linear convergence of the ADMM with the step size range $(0,2)$ for the quadratic programming case under a condition that turns out to be tight.",

They are closely related to the best complex rank-one approximations to higher-order tensors. The problem of finding US-eigenpairs can be regarded as an unconstraint nonlinear optimization problem with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables. Optimization methods of this kind of problem often need a first- or second-order derivative of the objective function. However, such methods cannot be applied to real valued functions of complex variables because they are not necessarily analytic in their argument. In this paper, we first prove that the number of US-eigenvalues of a symmetric complex tensor is finite. Then, we study how to find US-eigenvalues of a symmetric complex tensor. We establish the first order complex Taylor series and Wintinger calculus of complex gradient of real-valued functions with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables. Based on this theory, we propose a norm descent cautious BFGS method for computing US-eigenpairs of a symmetric complex tensor. The global and superlinear convergence of the proposed method are established.

        "abstract": "The transition states on potential energy surface belong to a class of special saddle points having only one unstable direction. They play key roles in the understanding the rare events like phase transitions and noise-induced transitions escaping a stable point. Many existing methods like dimer method have been widely used for finding transition state by local search. Here we review our work on theoretic and numerical progresses: the gentlest ascent dynamics (Nonlinearity, vol. 24, pp. 1831, 2011) and the iterative minimization algorithm (J. Comp. Phys. vol 309, pp 69-87. 2016). We also introduce the  improvement  for spatially-extended models   by the aid of convex splitting method (with Shuting Gu0. The work is supported by HK GRF 11304715.

        "abstract": "Water is one of the most common materials on earth, but the understanding of the microscopic mechanism of the ice melting is still lacking. The ice melting is a typical rare event: the time spend by the system in the ice state is orders of magnitude longer than the transition time to the liquid state, which leads to a substantial difficulty for the microscopic simulation techniques like the molecular dynamics simulation. In this talk, the computation of the equilibrium melting path is made possible by coupling the string method with the molecular dynamics. We investigate the microscopic mechanism of the formation of the liquid nucleus in the bulk hexagonal ice, and disclose a different scenario from the classical nucleation theory at the early stage of the melting. The new techniques that accelerate the molecular dynamics simulation are also introduced in this talk.",

For longer rods we find that the formation of the (stable) smectic phase out of a supersaturated isotropic state is strongly suppressed by an isotropic-nematic spinodal instability that causes huge spinodal-like orientation fluctuations with nematic clusters diverging in size. Our results show that glassy dynamics and spinodal instabilities set kinetic limits to nucleation in highly supersaturated hard-rod fluids.",

The stability of the CB state is determined by the energy barrier separating it from the wetted state. In this work, we study the CB to Wenzel transition using the climbing string method [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 126}, 164103 (2007), J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 138}, 134105 (2013)]. We compute the transition states and energy barriers for a three-dimensional droplet on patterned surfaces.  The liquid-vapor coexistence is modeled using the mean field theory. Numerical results are obtained for surfaces patterned with straight pillars and nails, respectively. It is found that on both type of surfaces, wetting occurs via infiltration of the liquid in a single groove. The reentrant geometry of nails creates large energy barrier for the wetting of the solid surface compared to straight pillars. We also study the effect of surface chemistry, pillar height and inter-pillar spacing on the energy barrier, and compare it with nails.",

In the previous literature, some theoretical models were used to predict the experimental phenomena of the phenotypic equilibrium, which were often explained by different concepts of stabilities of the models. Here we present a stochastic multi-phenotype branching model by integrating conventional cellular hierarchy with phenotypic plasticity mechanisms of cancer cells. Based on our model, it is shown that: (i) our model can serve as a framework to unify the previous models for the phenotypic equilibrium, and then harmonizes the different kinds of average-level stabilities proposed in these models; and (ii) path-wise convergence of our model provides a deeper understanding to the phenotypic equilibrium from stochastic point of view. That is, the emergence of the phenotypic equilibrium is rooted in the stochastic nature of (almost) every sample path, the average-level stability just follows from it by averaging stochastic samples.",

When coupled with the energy generating mechanism, the coupled system can be used to describe a live system or active matter system.

We theoretically develop a multiscale association analysis to overcome this difficulty. Specifically, we first show why conditional mutual information (CMI)/partial correlation (PC) suffers from an underestimation problem for biological networks with strong correlations. Then, we propose a new measure, partial association (PA), based on the multiscale conditional mutual information (MCMI), to solve this problem. We show that linear PA and nonlinear PA can quantify the direct associations in biological networks in an accurate manner from both theoretical and computational aspects. Both simulated models and real datasets demonstrate that PA is superior to PC and CMI in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We will also mention some new ideas still in progressing.",

We address the issue of why the second order maximum entropy model, by using only firing rates and second order correlations of neurons as constraints, can well capture the observed distribution of neuronal firing patterns in many neuronal networks, thus, conferring its great advantage in that the degree of complexity in the analysis of neuronal activity data reduces drastically from O( ) to O( ), where n is the number of neurons under consideration. We first derive an expression for the effective interactions of the n-th order maximum entropy model using all orders of correlations of neurons as constraints and show that there exists a recursive relation among the effective interactions in the model. Then, via a perturbative analysis, we explore a possible dynamical state in which this recursive relation gives rise to the strengths of higher order interactions always smaller than the lower orders. Both numerical simulations and experimental data demonstrate the existence of such dynamical state in neuronal network dynamics. Finally, we invoke this hierarchy of effective interactions to provide a possible mechanism underlying the success of the second order maximum entropy model.",
